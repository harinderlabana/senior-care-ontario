## A Checklist for Choosing a Long-Term Care Home in Ontario

**Introduction**

Choosing a long-term care home for a loved one is one of the most significant decisions a family can make. It's a process that requires careful consideration, research, and often, emotional resilience. To help guide you through this important journey, we've put together a comprehensive checklist based on best practices and what families in Ontario need to know.

Remember, the starting point for all long-term care applications in Ontario is **Ontario Health at Home** (call 310-2222). Their Care Coordinators will assess eligibility and guide you through the official application process.

**Phase 1: Initial Research and Needs Assessment**

Before you even start looking at specific homes, clarify your loved one's needs and your family's priorities.

- **Assess Your Loved One's Needs:**
  - What level of medical care is required (e.g., wound care, medication management, specialized dementia care)?
  - What level of personal care is needed (e.g., bathing, dressing, feeding)?
  - Are there any specific behavioral or cognitive challenges (e.g., wandering, aggression)?
  - What are their social and recreational interests?
  - What language and cultural preferences do they have?
  - What is their budget for accommodation (basic, semi-private, private)?
- **Geographic Preference:** Which areas are most convenient for family visits? Consider specific neighbourhoods in Hamilton or surrounding areas.
- **Gather Information from Ontario Health at Home:**
  - Discuss your loved one's assessed care needs with their Care Coordinator.
  - Get a list of available long-term care homes that can meet their needs.
  - Understand the estimated wait times for preferred homes.
  - Inquire about any special programs or units (e.g., dementia care, palliative care).

**Phase 2: Online Research and Shortlisting Homes**

Utilize online resources to narrow down your choices.

- **Ministry of Long-Term Care Online Search:** The Ontario government provides an online search tool for long-term care homes. Use this to find homes in your desired area (e.g., Hamilton) and view their:
  - Inspection reports and compliance history.
  - Resident satisfaction surveys.
  - Staffing levels (if available).
  - Accreditation status.
- **Home Websites:** Visit the websites of shortlisted homes to learn about their:
  - Mission and philosophy of care.
  - Programs and services offered.
  - Amenities (e.g., dining, common areas, outdoor spaces).
  - Photos and virtual tours (if available).
- **Reviews and Testimonials:** Look for reviews from other families and residents on various online platforms, but take them with a grain of salt.

**Phase 3: Visiting Homes (Virtual and In-Person)**

Once you have a shortlist, it's time to experience the homes firsthand.

- **Schedule Tours:** Contact homes to arrange virtual tours or in-person visits. It's best to visit at different times of day if possible.
- **During the Visit, Observe and Ask About:**
  - **First Impressions:** Is the home clean, bright, and welcoming? Does it smell pleasant?
  - **Staff Interaction:**
    - Do staff members seem friendly, engaged, and respectful towards residents?
    - Do they interact with residents in a way that respects their dignity?
    - Are staff visible and readily available?
    - What is the staff-to-resident ratio, especially for PSWs and nurses?
  - **Resident Appearance & Engagement:**
    - Do residents appear well-groomed and comfortable?
    - Are residents engaged in activities, or are many just sitting idle?
    - Do they seem happy and active?
  - **Living Environment:**
    - **Rooms:** Are rooms clean, well-lit, and personalized? Is there adequate space for personal belongings?
    - **Common Areas:** Are common areas clean, comfortable, and inviting? Are they being used by residents?
    - **Dining:** Is the dining area clean and appealing? What is the food like (ask to see a menu, observe mealtime)? Can special dietary needs be accommodated?
    - **Outdoor Space:** Is there a safe, accessible outdoor area for residents?
  - **Activities & Programs:**
    - What is the daily activity schedule?
    - Are there activities that match your loved one's interests and abilities?
    - Is there a variety of cognitive, physical, and social activities?
    - How are residents encouraged to participate?
  - **Medical Care:**
    - How often does a doctor visit? What is the procedure for medical emergencies?
    - How are medications managed and administered?
    - What specialized care is available (e.g., palliative care, wound care)?
  - **Safety & Security:**
    - Are emergency exits clearly marked? Is there a fire safety plan?
    - What are the security measures for residents, especially those with wandering tendencies?
    - How are falls prevented and managed?
  - **Communication & Family Involvement:**
    - How does the home communicate with families about a resident's well-being or changes in health?
    - Is there a Family Council? How can families get involved?
    - What are the visiting policies?
  - **Policies & Procedures:**
    - What are the policies on personal items, laundry, and hair care?
    - How are complaints addressed?
    - What is the process for bringing in external services (e.g., private physiotherapy)?
    - Ask to see a copy of the Residents' Bill of Rights and their policies on restraint and abuse prevention.
  - **Costs:** Confirm all fees, what is included, and any potential extra charges.

**Phase 4: Final Decision and Application**

- **Review and Compare:** Use your checklist to objectively compare your top choices.
- **Consult:** Discuss your findings with your loved one (if capable), other family members, and the Ontario Health at Home Care Coordinator.
- **Make Your Choice:** Submit your application through Ontario Health at Home, listing your preferred homes in order. Be prepared for potential waitlists.

Choosing a long-term care home is a deeply personal process. By using this comprehensive checklist, you can feel more confident and prepared to find a home that provides the best possible care and quality of life for your loved one.
