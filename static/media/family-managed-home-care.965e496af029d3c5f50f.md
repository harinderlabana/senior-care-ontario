## The "Family-Managed Home Care" Program in Ontario: Taking Control of Your Loved One's Care

**Introduction**

For many families, keeping a loved one at home for as long as possible is a priority. While Ontario Health at Home provides publicly funded care, some families desire a greater level of control and flexibility over who provides the care and how it's delivered. That's where the **Family-Managed Home Care (FMHC) Program** in Ontario comes in.

This unique program empowers eligible patients, or their substitute decision-makers, to directly manage their home care services, offering a new dimension of choice and autonomy.

**What is the Family-Managed Home Care Program?**

The Family-Managed Home Care Program is an alternative model of care delivery where **Ontario Health at Home** (formerly Home & Community Care Support Services) provides funding directly to eligible patients or their substitute decision-makers (often a family member). Instead of Ontario Health at Home arranging and scheduling care providers, the family takes on the responsibility of hiring, training, scheduling, and managing their own care providers.

This program shifts the control from the system to the family, allowing for highly personalized care that truly fits the unique needs and preferences of the individual.

**Who is Eligible for Family-Managed Home Care?**

Eligibility for FMHC is determined by Ontario Health at Home after a comprehensive assessment of the patient's needs. It's generally designed for patients with more complex or specific care needs where traditional agency-provided care might not offer the required flexibility.

While exact criteria can vary, the program is often targeted towards:

- **Children with complex medical needs:** Requiring highly specialized or continuous care.
- **Adults with acquired brain injuries:** Who may benefit from highly individualized care plans and consistent caregivers.
- **Eligible home-schooled children:** Where home care needs are integrated with their educational environment.
- **Patients in extraordinary circumstances:** As assessed and determined by Ontario Health at Home, where family management of care would significantly improve the patient's quality of life or care outcomes.

In addition to the patient's eligibility, the **substitute decision-maker (SDM)** (the family member managing the care) must also be assessed. The SDM needs to demonstrate they are capable and willing to take on the significant responsibilities involved in managing care, including:

- Recruiting and hiring care providers (e.g., PSWs, nurses).
- Managing funding and financial reporting to Ontario Health at Home.
- Scheduling and supervising caregivers.
- Ensuring the care plan is delivered effectively and safely.
- Handling all administrative and employment-related tasks.

**Benefits of Family-Managed Home Care**

- **Greater Control and Flexibility:** Families choose who provides care, when it's provided, and how specific tasks are carried out. This can lead to a more consistent and person-centred approach.
- **Improved Continuity of Care:** By directly employing caregivers, families can build long-term relationships with individuals who become deeply familiar with their loved one's unique needs and personality.
- **Personalized Matching:** Families can select caregivers who are a good personality match or who have specific skills or cultural understanding.
- **Empowerment:** It empowers families to be more actively involved and take ownership of their loved one's care journey.
- **Potential for Innovation:** Families might find creative ways to use the funding to meet unique needs not easily accommodated by standard care models.

**Responsibilities of the Family Manager**

While the benefits are significant, the FMHC program requires a substantial commitment from the family manager. Responsibilities include:

- **Financial Management:** Receiving, managing, and reporting on the funds provided by Ontario Health at Home. This includes payroll, taxes, and record-keeping.
- **Human Resources:** Recruiting, interviewing, hiring, training, supervising, and, if necessary, terminating caregivers.
- **Scheduling and Coordination:** Creating and managing caregiver schedules to ensure consistent and adequate coverage.
- **Quality Assurance:** Monitoring the quality of care provided and ensuring it aligns with the care plan and the patient's needs.
- **Compliance:** Adhering to all program guidelines and reporting requirements set by Ontario Health at Home.

**How to Learn More and Apply**

If you believe the Family-Managed Home Care Program could be a good fit for your loved one, your first step is to speak with their **Care Coordinator at Ontario Health at Home**.
